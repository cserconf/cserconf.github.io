			  <h5>Automated Program Generation for Testing and Repair</h5>
		     <p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Given either a specification written in natural language or an input program, automated program generation techniques produce a program according to the given specification or by modifying the input program. Automated program generation is a powerful technique that can be used for finding bugs in software systems that take programs as input or fixing bugs in the input programs. In this talk, I will share our latest results on automated program generation for (1) fixing bugs in large language model (LLM) based automated program generation, (1) testing static program analyzers. For the first part of the talk, I will present our study that categorizes common mistakes in LLM like Codex, and our insights in applying automated program repair techniques in fixing mistakes by Codex. For the second part of the talk, I will introduce several automated testing techniques that find bugs in static analyzers using semantic-preserving transformations, and annotation synthesizers.

			  <h5>Taming Android Compatibility Issues: The way back and the way forward</h5>
		     <p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> The world is going mobile. Android has surpassed its counterparts and become the most popular operating system all over the world. The openness and fast evolution of Android are the key factors that lead to its rapid growth. However, these characteristics have also created the notorious problem: Android fragmentation. There are numerous different Android device models and operating system versions in use, making it difficult for app developers to exhaustively test their apps on these devices. An Android app can behave differently on the different device models, inducing various compatibility issues that reduce software reliability.
			     Such fragmentation-induced compatibility issues (compatibility issues for short) have been well-recognized as a prominent problem in Android app development. In this talk, I will introduce the problem of Android compatibility issues, review the past efforts to address Android compatibility issues and discuss potential research opportunities surrounding Android compatibility issues.

              <h3>Tutorial</h3>
		    <h4>Software Engineering for Foundational Model-Powered Software (FMWare)</h4>

                Abstract: 
                Foundation Models (FM) like GPT-4 have given rise to FMware, FM-powered applications, which represent a new generation of software that is developed with new roles, assets, and paradigms. FMware has been widely adopted in both software engineering (SE) research (e.g., test generation) and industrial products (e.g., GitHub copilot), despite the numerous challenges introduced by the stochastic nature of FMs. Such challenges jeopardize the quality and trustworthiness of FMware. In our technical brief, we will present the latest research and industrial practices in engineering FMware, and discuss the SE challenges and opportunities facing both researchers and practitioners in the FMware era.
	<br>	<br>
                The tutorial is unique in that it is presented from an SE point of view, not an AI point-of-view ensuring that attendees are not bogged into complex mathematical and AI details unless they are essential for contextualizing the SE challenges and opportunities.
