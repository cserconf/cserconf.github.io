              <h5>Source Code Diff Revolution</h5>
              <p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em>  Software developers spend a significant portion of the workday trying to understand and review the code changes of their teammates. Currently, most code reviewing and change comprehension is done using textual diff tools, such as the commit diff in GitHub or Gerrit. Such diff tools are insufficient, especially for complex changes, which move code within the same file or between different files. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) diff tools brought several improvements in making easier the understanding of source code changes. However, they still have some constraints and limitations that affect negatively their accuracy. In this keynote, I will demonstrate these limitations using real case studies from open-source projects. At the same time, I will show how the AST diff generated by our tool addresses these limitations. Finally, I will introduce the Benchmark we created based on commits from the Defects4J and Refactoring Oracle datasets, and present the precision and recall of state-of-the-art AST diff tools on our benchmark. Vive la révolution!

			  <h5>Towards More Effective Software Engineering Chatbots</h5>
		     <p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Software chatbots are used in many aspects of the software development process. These chatbots work alongside developers, providing assistance in various software development tasks, from answering development questions to running tests and controlling services. While there are numerous chatbots, and their capability of supporting software practitioners is encouraging, little is known about the development challenges and usage benefits of software engineering chatbots. 
              </p>
		   <p>In this talk, I will present our in-depth study to understand the most pressing and difficult challenges faced by chatbot practitioners in developing chatbots. I will present our chatbot, MSRBot, that answers software development and maintenance questions.
			   </p>
		   <p> Based on our studies, we have identified two critical challenges in chatbot development: selecting a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) platform for chatbot implementation and curating a high-quality dataset to train the NLU. To help developers create more efficient chatbots, we assess the performance of multiple widely used NLUs using representative software engineering tasks to guide chatbot developers in designing more efficient chatbots. Additionally, we propose approaches for augmenting software engineering chatbot datasets. Our work helps advance the state-of-the-art in the use of chatbots in software engineering.

		   <p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Continuous integration is a DevOps practice in which software changes are frequently and automatically built, tested, and deployed. The primary objectives of continuous integration are to identify and address bugs quickly, and to improve software quality. However, the complexity of modern software systems and the lack of debugging information can make it challenging to locate and understand the root causes of bugs. In my upcoming talk, I will share my research insights into the challenges of automated debugging in DevOps and how they contribute to my broader goal of improving software quality and reliability. I will discuss how my past research, with a particular focus on developing new debugging innovations to minimize development and maintenance costs, has contributed to the field of automated debugging. Additionally, I will present my vision for the future of automated debugging in DevOps.

			  <h5>Automated Program Generation for Testing and Repair</h5>
		     <p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> Given either a specification written in natural language or an input program, automated program generation techniques produce a program according to the given specification or by modifying the input program. Automated program generation is a powerful technique that can be used for finding bugs in software systems that take programs as input or fixing bugs in the input programs. In this talk, I will share our latest results on automated program generation for (1) fixing bugs in large language model (LLM) based automated program generation, (1) testing static program analyzers. For the first part of the talk, I will present our study that categorizes common mistakes in LLM like Codex, and our insights in applying automated program repair techniques in fixing mistakes by Codex. For the second part of the talk, I will introduce several automated testing techniques that find bugs in static analyzers using semantic-preserving transformations, and annotation synthesizers.

			  <h5>Taming Android Compatibility Issues: The way back and the way forward</h5>
		     <p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> The world is going mobile. Android has surpassed its counterparts and become the most popular operating system all over the world. The openness and fast evolution of Android are the key factors that lead to its rapid growth. However, these characteristics have also created the notorious problem: Android fragmentation. There are numerous different Android device models and operating system versions in use, making it difficult for app developers to exhaustively test their apps on these devices. An Android app can behave differently on the different device models, inducing various compatibility issues that reduce software reliability.
			     Such fragmentation-induced compatibility issues (compatibility issues for short) have been well-recognized as a prominent problem in Android app development. In this talk, I will introduce the problem of Android compatibility issues, review the past efforts to address Android compatibility issues and discuss potential research opportunities surrounding Android compatibility issues.

		    <h4>Software Engineering for Foundational Model-Powered Software (FMWare)</h4>

                Abstract: 
                Foundation Models (FM) like GPT-4 have given rise to FMware, FM-powered applications, which represent a new generation of software that is developed with new roles, assets, and paradigms. FMware has been widely adopted in both software engineering (SE) research (e.g., test generation) and industrial products (e.g., GitHub copilot), despite the numerous challenges introduced by the stochastic nature of FMs. Such challenges jeopardize the quality and trustworthiness of FMware. In our technical brief, we will present the latest research and industrial practices in engineering FMware, and discuss the SE challenges and opportunities facing both researchers and practitioners in the FMware era.
	<br>	<br>
                The tutorial is unique in that it is presented from an SE point of view, not an AI point-of-view ensuring that attendees are not bogged into complex mathematical and AI details unless they are essential for contextualizing the SE challenges and opportunities.

		    <h4>Software Engineering for Foundational Model-Powered Software (FMWare)</h4>

                Abstract: 
                Foundation Models (FM) like GPT-4 have given rise to FMware, FM-powered applications, which represent a new generation of software that is developed with new roles, assets, and paradigms. FMware has been widely adopted in both software engineering (SE) research (e.g., test generation) and industrial products (e.g., GitHub copilot), despite the numerous challenges introduced by the stochastic nature of FMs. Such challenges jeopardize the quality and trustworthiness of FMware. In our technical brief, we will present the latest research and industrial practices in engineering FMware, and discuss the SE challenges and opportunities facing both researchers and practitioners in the FMware era.
	<br>	<br>
                The tutorial is unique in that it is presented from an SE point of view, not an AI point-of-view ensuring that attendees are not bogged into complex mathematical and AI details unless they are essential for contextualizing the SE challenges and opportunities.
